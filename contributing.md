# Contributing

I welcome contributions and suggestions to help improve this script.


### Code Contribution Workflow:

1.  [Fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2.  Create a branch (`git checkout -b my-branch`)
3.  Stage and commit your changes (`git commit -am 'description of my changes'`)
4.  Push the changes to your fork (`git push origin my-branch`)
5.  [Submit a pull request to the parent repo](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). Please read INN's [guide to submitting pull requests](/how-to-work-with-us/pull-requests.md) to see what is expected in a good pull request message.

Additionally, you can [create issues](https://github.com/benlk/looming_midterm/issues) on this repo to suggest changes or improvements.

### Standards

- Use [markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for all documents
- If your pull request changes a file's name or the location of a file within the repository, please check all other files in the repository for links to the former filename. (`git grep "old-filename-here.md"`)
